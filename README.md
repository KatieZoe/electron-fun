# My First Electron Desktop Application 
 
Working through [electronjs - quick-start](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/quick-start) and [tutorial](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/tutorial-first-app)

### Goal - to create a desktop app for my own tech writing practice. 

**Problem:** Lacking confidence in tech writing 
**Solution:** Making tech writing enjoyable and personal by creating a space for myself that works to my organisational practices. 
**Notes:** This will likely start out quite messy as I create the space and as I work out the best way for me to organise what I know. I want to start by making the application vibrant and pleasurable to visit. I want the application to evolve in it's display. 

###### Ideas: 
**Sticky notes** - important concepts I need to see regularly to reinforce in my mind. 
**Folders for specifics** - similar to gitbook... but a library of what I have learnt and can regurgitate about different languages, frameworks and industry standards. This should be it's own section and easy to search through. 
**A section that follows a journal type concept:** Aimless writing to practice writing in general and to allow free thought to come out without worrying about presentation or organisation. Something I can potentially pull from but it's ok to be disorganised. This will need to be visually appealing... import nice fonts, very basic clean page and maybe the ability to highlight and add sticky notes.... stretch goal on this would be to make it look like a notebook with coloured tags hanging out the side of the pages for notes I deem worth coming back to. This could be consolidated into one journal per year or more frequently depending on the user.
